We are going to build a small three-LED arduino communication device, known as the Arduino-Phone. The device will be able to send 3 different signals to it&amp;rsquo;s counterpart, and shall also be able to receive these signals back. The device is operated using simple buttons and will display the reception or transmission using its LEDs. The Arduino-Phone definitely does not fall into the category of revolutionairy technology, but still is a pretty cool device.</description></item></channel></rss>
