I am a student who likes to do cool programming and arduino projects in my free time. I wanted to make a blog-post for some time now, but never came around to actually doing it. Until now! In the future I plan to make more blog posts in the future on different projects.
For who is this blog? This blog is primarily meant for people that are looking for some cool technical projects.</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://www.nielsburghoorn.com/page/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nielsburghoorn.com/page/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
