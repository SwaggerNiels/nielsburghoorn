## Why this blog?

I am a student who likes to do cool programming and arduino projects in my free time. I wanted to make a blog-post for some time now, but never came around to actually doing it. Until now! In the future I plan to make more blog posts in the future on different projects.

## For who is this blog?

This blog is primarily meant for people that are looking for some cool technical projects. I try to explain everything to a high level of detail, such that almost *anyone* reading these blogs will be able to replicate the complete project.

## Academic background

I did my Bsc Nanobiology at the TU Delft and Erasmus University.

Currently following the TU Delft Msc Biomedical Engineering, Track 2: Biomedical Devices.

<!-- My thesis project at Erasmus Medical Center, was titled 
"*Developing a standard method for the assessment of subclonal architecture reconstruction*".
In this project I have worked with big datasets (genomic information), and constructed a framework and used algorithms for the assessment of subclonal compositions in tumor samples. This project was done under the supervision of Harmen van de Werken and Alberto Nakauma at CCBC. -->


<!-- (supervised by Prof. Dr. Ir. Serdijn).
In my master electives I have chosen to pick many Electrical engineering courses such as:
*  Semiconductor Device Physics
*  Sensors and Actuators
*  Bioelectricity
*  Integrated Circuits and MEMS Technology
*  Microsystem Integration -->
