# Academic background

I did my Bsc Nanobiology at the TU Delft and Erasmus University.

My thesis project at Erasmus Medical Center, was titled 
"*Developing a standard method for the assessment of subclonal architecture reconstruction*".
In this project I have worked with big datasets (genomic information), and constructed a framework and used algorithms for the assessment of subclonal compositions in tumor samples. This project was done under the supervision of Harmen van de Werken and Alberto Nakauma at CCBC.

Currently following the Msc Biomedical Engineering, Track 2: Biomedical Devices (supervised by Prof. Dr. Ir. Serdijn).
In my master electives I have chosen to pick many Electrical engineering courses such as:
*  Semiconductor Device Physics
*  Sensors and Actuators
*  Bioelectricity
*  Integrated Circuits and MEMS Technology
*  Microsystem Integration
